== Module: Container Intro

* What are containers and how do they work
* Containers vs. VMs 
* History of containers and rise of Docker
* Docker concepts: daemon, hub, dockerfile, CLI
* Running containers with various options

=== Objectives and exercises
_The student understands the concepts and use cases of container technology and is able to describe them. The first exercise is to pull sample images from an image registry (e.g. Docker Hub) and interact with them (run, expose port, execute shell, cleanup etc). After that the student can show how to build a custom image via Dockerfile and push it to a registry for others to access. Complete the exercises handed out via URL._

=== Review questions

* What is the difference between a container and a VM? List 3 criteria
* Which technologies led to the evolution of docker (and why)? VMs, namespaces, chroot, cgroups, LXC, CF/Google containers
* What is the difference between a docker daemon and the docker hub? Daemon = runtime, Docker Hub = public registry
* What is the difference between docker run, docker pull and docker start?
* Which command transitions from a container instance to an image?
* What does docker exec do?

=== Open questions

* Does docker run also building images (prior to ruuning them)? "combination of docker create and start"

== Module: Spring Boot Introduction

* Background: Spring Framework - History & components
* Spring <- -> Spring Boot
* Spring Initializr (start.spring.io) & starter dependencies
* Basic project structure (folders, configuration ..)
* "Hello, World!" example explained
* Using Actuator

=== Objectives
_The student is able to build and configure an own Spring Boot application from scratch with the IDE of choice. The exercise is to build an own "Hello, World!" application that exposes various REST endpoints and is able to execute CRUD operations on the state of the application. Optional: Add logging and testing, configure Actuator._

=== Exercises

* Build a simple Spring Boot Microservice with the following starter dependencies: Web, Actuator
* Run the microservice and test the endpoint /actuator/health and /actuator/info
* Annotate the Microservice with @RestController and implement a "Hello, World!" method, which responds to an HTTP GET request.
* Add some basic "functionality" to make the service react to HTTP GET, POST calls (e.g. modify an internal list). Optional: PUT and DELETE
* Change the configuration to make the server run on port 8081 instead of 8080

=== Review questions

* What is the difference (and common aspects) between Spring and Spring Boot?
* What is the web page to start building your spring boot apps?
* What kind of things can you configure on that Initializr? 
* What is the role of the Actuator?

== Module: Container Images

* Difference and relation between container and container images
* Concepts of image layers
* "docker commit"
* History of Dockerfile. Initial, multi-stage & BuildKit
* Building container for Java apps
* Using Jib, Cloud-Native Buildpacks and Paketo

=== Objectives and exercises
_The student understands the relation between container image and container, how to instantiate a container from an image and how to commit to a new image from an existing container. The exercise is to build the previous Spring Boot application and put it into a container image using various options, e.g. different Dockerfile options, Google JIB, CND, Paketo and more ...? The student is aware and able to describe on a high-level what the different fundamentals of the various approaches are and is able to list advantages and disadvantages._

=== Review questions

* List 3 different options to build a container image
* Explain docker build vs docker commit 
* List 2 evolution steps of the Dockerfile and provide 1 improvement for each step (multi-stage, buildkit, caching)
* Explain or list 1 advantage&disadvantage comparing JIB and Paketo/CNB to original Dockerfiles
* How is a container image build up internally? Layers(!) -> effective storage of container binaries
* Which are criterias you can think that make image building "better" - less manual steps, less config, smaller size, faster build speed, effective structure

== Module: Persistence

* Recap of container
* Spring Data
* Concept of entities and repositories
* JPA and JDBC basics
* H2, PostgeSQL, MySQL - configuration via Spring Boot profiles
* Running databases as Docker images

image::images/spring_data.png[Spring Data]

=== Objectives and exercises
_The student is able to build a Spring Boot application (or extend an existing one) with Spring Data configuration. The exercise is to create an application, which performs CRUD operations on a database backend. The database can either be in-memory (H2) or a (containerized) PostgreSQL. The Optional: Provide a docker-compose file to stand up a multi-container environment with application and database._

* Synchronous communication
* REST 
  * HTTP, Basics, Maturity Model
* Synchronous communication with RestTemplate (and Feign)

=== Objectives and exercises
_The student understands the concepts of an API and synchronous communication in distributed systems and can explain it in own words. The exercise is to implement a CRUD application client to work with a REST API using either RestTemplate (or Feign)._
