image::images/docker_diagram.png[Relation Container and Image]

=== Objectives and exercises
_The student understands the concepts and use cases of container technology and is able to describe them. The first exercise is to pull sample images from an image registry (e.g. Docker Hub) and interact with them (run, expose port, execute shell, cleanup etc). After that the student can show how to build a custom image via Dockerfile and push it to a registry for others to access. Complete the exercises handed out via URL._

* What is the difference between a container and a VM? List 3 criteria
* Which technologies led to the evolution of docker (and why)? VMs, namespaces, chroot, cgroups, LXC, CF/Google containers
* What is the difference between a docker daemon and the docker hub? Daemon = runtime, Docker Hub = public registry
* What is the difference between docker run, docker pull and docker start?
* Which command transitions from a container instance to an image?
* What are the Docker components and describe them?
* What does docker exec do? Provide a pseudo-code example and explain what it does

=== Objectives and exercises
_The student understands the relation between container image and container, how to instantiate a container from an image and how to commit to a new image from an existing container. The exercise is to build the previous Spring Boot application and put it into a container image using various options, e.g. different Dockerfile options, Google JIB, CND, Paketo and more ...? The student is aware and able to describe on a high-level what the different fundamentals of the various approaches are and is able to list advantages and disadvantages._

=== Review questions

* List 3 different options to build a container image
* Explain docker build vs docker commit 
* List 2 evolution steps of the Dockerfile and provide 1 improvement for each step (multi-stage, buildkit, caching)
* Explain or list 1 advantage&disadvantage comparing JIB and Paketo/CNB to original Dockerfiles
* How is a container image build up internally? Layers(!) -> effective storage of container binaries
* Which are criterias you can think that make image building "better" - less manual steps, less config, smaller size, faster build speed, effective structure
